# What are Variables?

### Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container.


### Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the `var` keyword.

## JavaScript Variable naming conventions:

* ### Contain `letters`, `numbers`, `$`, or `_`
* ### Begin with `letter`, or `_`
* ### Variable names are case-sensitive.
* ### Avoid `RESERVED` words



#
## JavaScript Variable Scope
### The scope of a variable is the region of your program in which it is defined. JavaScript variables have only two scopes.

* ### Global Variables − A global variable has global scope which means it can be defined anywhere in your JavaScript code.

* ### Local Variables − A local variable will be visible only within a function where it is defined. Function parameters are always local to that function.

&nbsp; 

### Within the body of a function, a local variable takes precedence over a global variable with the same name. If you declare a local variable or function parameter with the same name as a global variable, you effectively hide the global variable. Take a look into the following example.
