# Arrays

### An array can hold multiple values within a single variable. This means that you can contain a list of values within an array and iterate through them.

### Each item or value that is inside of an array is called an element. You can refer to the elements of an array by using an index number.

### Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, arrays are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].
#
### An array of strings, for example, looks like this:
```javascript
let fish = ["shark", "cuttlefish", "clownfish", "eel"];
```
&nbsp;
### If we call the variable fish, weâ€™ll receive the following output:
```javascript
console.log(fish);

// output: -> ["shark", "cuttlefish", "clownfish", "eel"];
```
&nbsp;
### Arrays are a very flexible data type because they are mutable in that they can have element values added, removed, and changed.

&nbsp;

## Indexing Arrays

### Arrays do not have name/value pairs. Instead, they are indexed with integer values beginning with `0`. You may hear the term `zero indexed`


### We can find out how many items are in an array with the length property.
```javascript
fish.length;

// output -> 4
```
&nbsp;
### If we want to find out the index number of a specific item in an array, such as clownfish, we can use the indexOf() method.
```javascript
fish.indexOf("clownfish");

// output -> 2
```
&nbsp; 

## Accessing Items in an Array

### An item in a JavaScript array is accessed by referring to the index number of the item in square brackets.
```javascript
fish[1];

// output -> "shark"
```
&nbsp;

### Attempting to access an item that doesn't exist will return undefined.
```javascript
fish[10];

// output -> undefined
```
&nbsp;
### In order to access items in a nested array, you would add another index number to correspond to the inner array.
```javascript
let nestedArray = [
    [
        "salmon",
        "halibut",
    ],
    [
        "coral",
        "reef",
    ]
];

nestedArray[1][0];

// output -> 'coral'
```
&nbsp;

## Adding an Item to an Array

### In our fish variable we had five items, which consisted of the indices from 0 to 4. If we want to add a new item to the array, we can assign a value to the next index.

```javascript
fish[5] = "squid";

// output -> ["shark", "cuttlefish", "clownfish", "eel", "squid"]
```

&nbsp; 
### We can also use a built-in javascript array methods to add data to the array. 

* ### Using the push() method, we add an item to the end of an array.

```javascript
fish.push("whale");

// output -> ["shark", "cuttlefish", "clownfish", "eel", "squid", "whale"]
```
&nbsp; 
* ### Using the unshift() method will add an item to the beginning of an array.
```javascript
fish.unshift("lobster");

console.log(fish);

// output -> ["lobster", "shark", "cuttlefish", "clownfish", "eel", "squid", "whale"]
```
&nbsp; 

## Modifying Items in Arrays:

### We can overwrite any value in an array by assigning a new value using the assignment operator, just like we would with a regular variable.

```javascript
fish[0] = "manatee";

// output -> ["manatee", "shark", "cuttlefish", "clownfish", "eel", "squid", "whale"]
```
&nbsp; 
### Another way to modify a value is using the splice() method with a new parameter. If we wanted to change the value of clownfish, which is the item at index 3, we could remove it and add a new item in its place.



```javascript
var removedItems = fish.splice(pos, n); 
// this is how to remove items, n defines the number of items to be removed, from that position(pos) onward to the end of array.

fish.splice(3, 1, "sea lion");

// output -> ["manatee", "shark", "cuttlefish", "sea lion", "eel", "squid", "whale"]
```

* ### The splice() method changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements `in place`.
