A database is a set of data stored in a computer. This data is usually structured in a way that makes the data easily accessible.


## WHAT IS A RELATIONAL DATABASE ?  ( `SQL` )
A relational database is a type of database. It uses a `structure` that allows us to identify and access data in relation to another piece of data in the database. Often, data in a relational database is organized into tables.

Relational databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite3 represent and store data in `tables and rows`

#### Are there other types of Databases?  -  `YES!!!`

## WHAT IS A NON-RELATIONAL DATABASE ?  ( `NoSQL` )

A `non-relational database` is any database that does not follow the relational model provided by traditional `relational database management systems`. 



For Example: Non-relational databases like MongoDB represent data in collections of `JSON documents`

## WHAT IS A RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (RDBMS)?
A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a program that allows you to create, update, and administer a relational database. Most relational database management systems use the `SQL` language to access the database.)
