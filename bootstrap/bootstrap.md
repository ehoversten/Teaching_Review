## The `Box-Model`

### History:
The box model has worked like this by default:

* Width + Padding + Border = actual visible/rendered `width` of an element's box

* Height + Padding + Border = actual visible/rendered `height` of an element's box

The CSS box model acts as a `container` which has the ability to modify properties including `borders`, `margin`, `padding` and the `content` itself. It is helpful to create the design and layout of web pages. The web browser renders every element as a rectangular box according to the CSS box model. The Box-Model has multiple properties in CSS. 

Some of them are as follows:

* Borders
* Margins
* Padding
* Content

The following figure illustrates the box model:

</p>
