* Local Storage
* Session Storgae

This includes Local Storage & Session Storage

### Session Storage

* Maintains the data stored into it for the duration of the page session


## Methods

* setItem(key, value)
* getItem(key)
* removeItem(key)
* key(n)
* clear()

#

How to access the storage
Both Local and Session Storage are available on the window object, so you can access them using sessionStorage and localStorage.

Their set of properties and methods is exactly the same, because they return the same object, a Storage object.

The Storage Object has a single property, length, which is the number of data items stored into it.
