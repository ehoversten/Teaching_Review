# Conditionals in JavaScript

### In computer science, conditional statements, conditional expressions and conditional constructs are features of a programming language, which perform different computations or actions depending on whether a programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates to true or false.

## if... else Statements:
- The most common type of conditional statement you'll use in JavaScript 


```javascript
if (test_condition) {
  // code to run if test_condition is true
} else {
  // run some other code instead
}
```

&nbsp; 

## else / if Statements:
- Typically used when we have more than two options of how we would like the logic of the code to perform.
- This way we can chain on extra choices/outcomes

```javascript
if (test_condition) {
  // code to run if test_condition is true
} else if (another_test_condition){
  // run some code if 'another_test_condition' evaluates to TRUE
} else if (third_test_condition) {
  // run some code if 'third_test_condition' evaluates to TRUE
} else {
  // run the code here if none of the conditions evaluate to TRUE
}
```
