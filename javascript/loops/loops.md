# Loops in JavaScript

###  There are many different kinds of loops, but they all essentially do the same thing: they `repeat an action some number of times` (and it's actually possible that number could be zero). The various loop mechanisms offer different ways to determine the start and end points of the loop.

&nbsp; 
## Do Loop

### The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. 

Syntax:
```javascript
do
  // code that runs as long as the condition passed to the while() statement evaluates to TRUE
while (condition);
```
&nbsp; 
### The code after the `do` statement is `always executed once` before the condition is checked. Then again until the while condition returns `false`

Example:
```javascript
let i = 0;

do {
  i += 1;
  console.log(i);
} while (i < 5);
```
