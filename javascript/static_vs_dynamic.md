# Statically Typed `vs` Dynamically Typed Language: 
&nbsp;
## Statically typed languages

### A language is `statically typed` if the TYPE of a variable is known at COMPILE TIME. For `static typed` languages this means that you as the programmer must specify what type each variable is!

### The main advantage here is that all kinds of checking can be done by the `compiler`, and therefore a lot of trivial bugs are caught at a very early stage.

Examples: C, C++, Java, Rust, Go, Scala

&nbsp;
## Dynamically typed languages
### A language is `dynamically typed` if the TYPE is associated with run-time values, and not named variables/fields/etc. This means that you as a programmer do not have to specify types every time.

Examples: Perl, Ruby, Python, PHP, JavaScript

&nbsp; 

* #### Most scripting languages have this feature as there is no compiler to do static type-checking anyway, but you may find yourself searching for a bug that is due to the interpreter misinterpreting the `type of a variable`.
